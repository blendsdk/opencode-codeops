# Fresh Scaffold

> Read this when `setup-codeops` detects **neither** a marker nor a flat layout — a repo with no
> CodeOps artifacts yet. Resolve paths via [_shared/layout-convention.md](../../_shared/layout-convention.md).

## What to create

Create **exactly** this minimal skeleton — nothing more (FR-6, AR #12):

```
codeops/
├── .codeops.yml          # the layout marker (schema below)
├── codeops.json          # structured quality/routing/metrics policy
├── 00-roadmap.md         # empty portfolio roadmap (0 features)
└── features/             # empty; per-feature dirs are created LAZILY on first RD/plan/task
```

Do **not** create `_maintenance/`, any `features/<name>/`, or any requirements/plans dirs up
front. Those appear lazily when the first RD, plan, or task is authored (AR #5).

## Steps

1. Confirm the repo is a git repo (suggest `git init` if not).
2. Create `codeops/features/` (the empty features dir).
3. Write `codeops/.codeops.yml` (the marker — `setup-codeops` is its sole writer).
4. Write `codeops/codeops.json` with the strict defaults below.
5. Write `codeops/00-roadmap.md` (empty portfolio — see the portfolio template in the `roadmap`
   skill; seed it with zero features and an empty Archived section).
6. Confirm the marker, policy, portfolio, and empty feature directory exist; report setup state
   rather than claiming project readiness.
7. Report what was created and what to do next (`make-requirements` / `make-plan` for the first
   feature; the feature folder is created lazily then).

## `codeops/codeops.json` (write verbatim)

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "mode": "strict",
  "artifacts": {"layout": "nested", "root": "codeops"},
  "quality": {
    "independentReview": true,
    "minimumReviewers": 1,
    "stopOnMajorFinding": true
  },
  "metrics": {"enabled": false}
}
```

## `codeops/.codeops.yml` (write verbatim)

```yaml
# CodeOps layout marker. Presence of this file opts the repo into the nested layout.
# Sole writer: the setup-codeops skill. Schema: _shared/layout-convention.md
codeopsLayout: nested
layoutVersion: "3.0.0"
integrationBranch: <the repo's integration branch — resolve; see the note below>
conventions:
  rdIdScope: per-feature
  taskIdPrefix: "T"
  maintenanceFeature: _maintenance
  archiveDir: codeops/_archive
```

Resolve `integrationBranch` to the repo's default branch — `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
(strip `origin/`), else the current branch, else `main`/`master`. It names the branch where features
integrate and derived files (the portfolio roadmap, `AGENTS.md`) are regenerated, so parallel feature
worktrees don't collide on them. The key is **optional** — every consumer auto-detects the same
default when it is absent — so this line is a convenience/pin, not a requirement.

## Notes

- The marker is what flips the repo into nested layout — write it **last** after the structured
  config and roadmap, so a half-finished
  scaffold never looks "set up".
- Scaffolding is intentionally simple, so it lives in skill prose; only the *migration* path
  needs the deterministic engine. For migration, see [migration.md](migration.md).

## Agent file installation

After scaffolding, copy the CodeOps OpenCode agent definitions into the project:

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/agents
cp "${CODEOPS_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/"*.md .opencode/agents/
```

This installs the 12 CodeOps subagent definitions (`executor`, `explorer`, `correctness-reviewer`, etc.) into `.opencode/agents/` where OpenCode will discover and load them automatically. These files are safe to commit to git. Users can override individual agent models in `opencode.json` under the `agent` key.
