# Reasoning effort (shared contract)

> **CodeOps Artifact Schema**: 1

CodeOps subagents normally inherit the parent session's model variant, so a top-tier parent
would pay top-tier reasoning cost for every child dispatch. Adaptive reasoning effort lets an
explicit source pick a level per dispatch or per skill run. This document is the shipped
contract consumed by the plugin and the skills. It is advisory by design and never a gate.

## Levels

| Level | Meaning | Typical work |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| `low` | Mechanical, fully specified, deterministic verification | Docs and formatting edits, renames, config updates |
| `medium` | Ordinary bounded feature work with known patterns | Standard implementation phases, recon, single-file reviews |
| `high` | Correctness- or security-sensitive, cross-cutting, or planning/review work | Requirements, planning, correctness/security review, ambiguous implementation |
| `max` | Adversarial or high-risk analysis where a missed detail is costly | Thorough preflight, complex or sensitive phases |

The four levels are the complete suggestion vocabulary. A level is applied only when the
runtime model exposes a matching variant, or when the model reports reasoning support but has no
variant record (the level is then written directly as the provider reasoning option). A level
the model does not expose leaves the request unchanged and never raises a provider error.
Routing policy is project configuration, not a suggestion:
`routing.roles.<agent>.reasoning` may name any value from the provider enum
(`none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`).

## Marker grammar

A dispatch marker is one standalone line in a dispatch message:

```text
[codeops-effort: <level>]
```

- The whole trimmed line must match `^\[codeops-effort:\s*(low|medium|high|max)\]\s*$`.
- The level is exactly lower-case. Unknown or malformed markers are ignored, never errors.
- Only user-role text parts of a message are scanned; tool output, diffs, and quoted documents
  are never scanned.
- The first valid marker in message order wins; additional markers are ignored.
- The marker is deliberately distinct from the human-readable plan line
  `> **Reasoning**: ...`, so a quoted plan line can never act as a machine directive.

For quality-agent packets the marker follows the dispatch header; for packet kinds without a
header it is the first line. `exec-plan` owns the composition rule.

A captured marker is remembered for the whole session: every request in that session uses it
until a newer marker replaces it or the session ends. This is what keeps the marker effective
when the host passes a later user message to the request hook.

## Precedence

The most specific source wins:

```text
dispatch marker  >  session auto-effort  >  routing.roles[<agent>].reasoning  >  inherit parent variant
```

| Source | Scope | Owner |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Dispatch marker | One child dispatch | `exec-plan` composes it from the phase suggestion or the run's forced level |
| Session auto-effort | One skill run in the user's session | `--auto-effort` through `scripts/codeops_effort.py` |
| Routing role default | Project policy for one agent name | `codeops/codeops.json` → `routing.roles.<agent>.reasoning` |
| Inherit | Everything else | The child keeps the parent model and variant |

Routing lookup applies only when the dispatching agent's name has an explicit `routing.roles`
entry. There are no built-in catalog defaults, hand-authored agents are untouched, and
generated specialists keep their embedded value unless the project adds a routing entry.

## Skill recommendation table

Used for suggestions and for a bare `--auto-effort`:

| Skill | Recommended level | Notes |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----- |
| `make-requirements` | `high` | Structured discovery and gap expansion |
| `make-plan` | `high` | Decomposition plus the Zero-Ambiguity Gate |
| `preflight` | `high`; `max` with `--thorough` | Adversarial multi-dimension audit |
| `grill-me` | `high` | Branch-by-branch disambiguation |
| `exec-plan` | current phase's `Reasoning:` level | Bare flag follows the phase; `=<level>` forces a constant |
| `retro-requirements` | `high` | Nine-phase archaeology |
| `upgrade-plan` | `high` | Content gate plus structural migration |
| `setup-codeops`, `setup-routing` | `high` (reference only) | Structure and policy authoring |
| `techdocs`, `analyze-project`, `clean-comments`, `outcome-review` | `medium` (reference only) | Structured but bounded |
| `roadmap`, `git-commit`, `github-issues` | `low` (reference only) | Mechanical bookkeeping |

Skills that accept `--auto-effort` are `make-requirements`, `make-plan`, `preflight`,
`grill-me`, `exec-plan`, `retro-requirements`, and `upgrade-plan`. Other skills document their
recommended levels for reference only and do not implement the flag.

## Plan suggestion derivation

`make-plan` derives an advisory level for every phase and every task mini-plan from signals it
already records:

| Signal | Suggested level |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Phase carries a complexity escalation approval, or a complex/sensitive tag | `max` |
| Phase carries a security, financial-integrity, concurrency, performance-critical, compiler-semantics, or migration lens/risk tag | `high` |
| Docs/config/rename-only phase with deterministic verification | `low` |
| Any other non-trivial phase | `medium` |

The line is written as `> **Reasoning**: <level> — <one-line reason>`. It is a suggestion: the
user may edit or delete it, and `exec-plan` never blocks on it. A plan without the line keeps
the inherited behavior.

## Auto-effort option

Skills listed above accept the flag. Parsing follows the existing standalone-token pattern
(`--auto-design`, `--explore-scope`): exactly one occurrence before the first `--` sentinel,
removed before resolving targets, paths, or modes; zero means advise-only; more than one or an
invalid `=<level>` is an argument error.

| Flag | Behavior |
| ---- | -------- |
| *(absent)* | Print `Suggested reasoning: <level> — <reason>` once at start (`exec-plan`: before each phase); change nothing |
| `--auto-effort` | Use the skill's recommended level (`exec-plan`: the current phase level) |
| `--auto-effort=<level>` | Use the named level; reject values outside the four-level set |

Semantics:

1. Announce `Auto-effort active — reasoning <level> applied for this run`.
2. Record the level for the session run through `scripts/codeops_effort.py`.
3. Clear it at run completion, before the final summary.
4. Run-scoped: the level applies from the point it is set until cleared or the session ends.
5. Fail-open: when the session temp directory is unavailable or the helper fails, print an
   advise-only note and continue; the skill never blocks.
6. Never a gate: effort affects cost and latency only. No readiness check, verification step,
   reviewer requirement, or finding gate may read it.

For `exec-plan`, a bare flag follows each phase's suggestion, while `--auto-effort=<level>`
forces that level for the whole run, including every dispatch marker composed during it.

## Optional tracing

Set `CODEOPS_EFFORT_TRACE=1` (or `true`) in the environment that starts OpenCode to record what
the plugin does. One content-free JSON line is appended per marker capture and per request to
`reasoning-effort-trace.jsonl` inside the session's scratch directory. Lines carry only a
timestamp, event name, message id, agent name, level, source, and applied flag — never prompt
text or file content. The trace lives with the rest of the session scratch and is removed with
it. Tracing is off by default and never affects a request.

## Suggestion-only guarantee

| Allowed | Forbidden |
| ------- | --------- |
| Printing a suggested level and its reason | Blocking a run because a level is missing or unsupported |
| Applying a level when a marker, flag, or routing entry explicitly asks | Overriding an explicit user plan edit with a derived default |
| Reporting the applied level and its source | Treating effort as an acceptance, review, or security control |
