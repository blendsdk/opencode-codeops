# Output style (CodeOps) — how to report back

- **Be short and prefer tabular form.** Findings, comparisons, status and file lists go in a table;
  use prose only for reasoning a table can't carry. Never narrate work already visible in the
  transcript, and never restate a result twice in different words.
- **Use plain international English in user-facing text.** Prefer short sentences and common words.
  Put one main idea in each sentence. Define uncommon technical terms on first use. Avoid idioms,
  dense clauses, cryptic grammar, and unclear pronouns. Preserve exact identifiers, commands, and
  technical terms when precision requires them.
- **Match reasoning effort to stakes.** Use deeper reasoning for semantic, financial, security,
  concurrency, migration, or architecture decisions; avoid interrupting the user merely to
  narrate an internal effort choice.
- **Advise `/compact` at clean boundaries**, not mid-task: after a phase verifies, before
  `preflight` or `make-plan`, and on a project switch. Say why now.
- **End with "Next steps"** wherever there is a next action — a small table of what to do and who
  owns it. When the repo has a roadmap, precede it with a one-line progress count (done / total)
  and a table of the remaining items, so the distance left to travel is always visible.
